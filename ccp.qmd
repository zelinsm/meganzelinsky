## Cleveland Community Cat Project

As the Executive Director of the Cleveland Community Cat Project, I am deeply committed to improving the welfare of community cats through evidence-based, sustainable practices. Our all-volunteer organization focuses on Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return (TNVR), fostering, and community education to enhance the quality of life for outdoor and community cats.

My role with Cleveland Community Cat Project allows me to combine my professional expertise in research and evidence-based practices with my lifelong passion for animal welfare. When I founded this organization several years ago, it was only with the intent to support my own animal welfare work. It has grown beyond what I ever planned for or expected. I am grateful to have the support of hundreds of volunteers and our incredible community in Cleveland, who keep us going and then some. Leading this organization has taught me the importance of collaboration, community partnerships, and compassion-driven leadership in achieving meaningful change.

## Our Mission

At Cleveland Community Cat Project, our mission is to empower communities to care for and coexist with community cats. We achieve this by:

-   Promoting TNVR as the gold standard for humane population management.
-   Providing education and resources to caregivers and community members.
-   Ensuring that every cat in our program receives the care and compassion they deserve.

## What Weâ€™ve Achieved

Since our founding, Cleveland Community Cat Project has:

-   Conducted hundreds of TNVR operations annually, preventing the birth of thousands of unwanted kittens.
