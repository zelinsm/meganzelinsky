Hi, I’m **Megan Zelinsky**—a researcher dedicated to improving research and care for patients with neurological disorders. I specialize in qualitative and mixed-methods research, neurosurgical treatment outcomes, and ethical challenges in clinical and research settings. I work at the intersection of clinical research and ethics, with a focus on advancing meaningful outcomes for patients.

As a Clinical Research Project Manager at Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute, I conduct qualitative analyses, support mixed-methods studies, manage databases and registries, and explore innovative approaches to aligning research and clinical practices with patient values. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Clinical Translational Science at Case Western Reserve University, where I am building the expertise necessary to advance my work in neuroethics, refine measures of research efficacy, and bridge the gap between research findings and patient care. I also enjoy mentoring students, and lecturing in ethics and neuroethics at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

I am passionate about integrating ethical principles and patient-centered perspectives into research practices, especially data management and analysis, and dedicated to improving outcomes for patients with neurological disorders.

When I’m not working on research or fostering kittens, I enjoy yoga, reading, and collaborating with like-minded professionals to create meaningful change in both human and animal health.
