Hi, I‚Äôm **Megan Zelinsky**‚Äîa clinical researcher and neuroethicist dedicated to improving research and care for patients with neurological disorders. I specialize in patient-centered research, neurosurgical treatment outcomes, and ethical challenges in clinical and research settings. I work at the intersection of clinical research and ethics, with a focus on advancing meaningful outcomes for patients.

As a researcher at Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute, I conduct qualitative analyses, support mixed-methods studies, and explore innovative approaches to aligning research practices with patient values. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Clinical and Translational Science at Case Western Reserve University, where I am building the expertise necessary to advance my work in neuroethics, refine measures of research efficacy, and bridge the gap between research findings and patient care. Grounded in the belief that ethics should guide every aspect of research and care, I also enjoy mentoring students, and lecturing in ethics and neuroethics at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

I am passionate about integrating ethical principles and patient-centered perspectives into research practices, especially data management and analysis. With a background in biology and bioethics, I‚Äôve dedicated my career to improving outcomes for patients with neurological disorders while advocating for animal welfare as the Executive Director of the Cleveland Community Cat Project.

When I‚Äôm not working on research or fostering kittens, I enjoy yoga, reading, and collaborating with like-minded professionals to create meaningful change in both human and animal health.
